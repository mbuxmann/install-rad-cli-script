# install-rad-cli-script
A script to install Radicle CLI.
Steps:
1. chmod u+x ./install.sh
2. ./install.sh 

Known issues:
Since source ~/.zshrc isn't working in script you will need to 
1. run install.sh, wait till it crashes. 
2. Close terminal and reopen it (this loads the path variable). 
3. Change directory to install.sh and run it again.

Busy fixing it.
